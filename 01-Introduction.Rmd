# Introduction {#intro}

It is always best to start a new line when you start each sentence. 
This will mean that when you are looking for the line when proofing the pdf it is **much** easier to find.

(You need to leave a space to actually start a new paragraph)

You can find out much more about using Bookdown [this link.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

The following text shows some of the things you can do with markdown, and how to reference papers in your .bib library. 

A handy trick is that you can \hl{highlight text}, for example for text that should be reviewed or for notes to self. 
Notice also that every fifth line is numbered: this can be turned off in the preamble.tex file. 

## Famous people in public health  
### John Snow 

John Snow is famous for, among other things, working out that cholera was waterborne [@Snow:1856]. 
He was an English physician and a leader in the development of anaesthesia and medical hygiene. 
He is considered one of the fathers of modern epidemiology, in part because of his work in tracing the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854. 

### Florence Nightingale 

Florence Nightingale was an English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing [@Nightingale:1992]. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers. 
She gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of "The Lady with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.

### Michael Marmot 

Michael Marmot led the Whitehall studies, which showed that socioeconomic *class inequalities can be bad for your health* (when you're at the **bottom**, not the top!) [@Marmot:1991]. 
He is Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London.

### Doll and Bradford-Hill

Along with others, these two lead studies that supported the idea, controversial at the time, that smoking is bad for you [@Doll:1950], causing: 

- Lung disease 
- Heart disease
- Yellow teeth
- Bad breath
